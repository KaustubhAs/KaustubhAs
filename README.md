## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a Machine Learning & Data Science engineer who enjoys building **end-to-end ML and GenAI systems** — from messy real-world data and ambiguous business problems to scalable, production-ready solutions.

I’ve worked on **customer lifecycle modeling, forecasting pipelines, LLM-powered automation, and RAG systems**, combining strong fundamentals in ML, statistics, and systems with hands-on experience in cloud and MLOps.

I especially enjoy problems where **data, models, and real business decisions intersect**.

## 🎯 What I’m Working Toward
My goal is to grow into a full-stack ML / AI engineer who can:
- Design scalable ML & GenAI systems end-to-end  
- Build reliable data pipelines and forecasting models  
- Translate vague business questions into measurable ML solutions  
- Ship models that actually get used in production
